# Swin Transformer Implementation

## Overview
This repository contains an implementation of the Swin Transformer, a hierarchical vision transformer for image classification and feature extraction. The model is designed to handle images efficiently using shifted window-based self-attention mechanisms.

## Features
- Implements Swin Transformer using PyTorch.
- Supports image classification and feature extraction.
- Optimized for scalability and efficiency.
- Easy-to-use modular architecture.

## Installation
To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/swin-transformer.git
cd swin-transformer
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Training
To train the Swin Transformer model, run the following command:
```bash
python train.py --config configs/swin_config.yaml
```

### Inference
For inference using a trained model:
```bash
python inference.py --image path/to/image.jpg --model path/to/trained_model.pth
```

## Configuration
Modify the `configs/swin_config.yaml` file to adjust model parameters such as:
- Patch size
- Window size
- Number of attention heads
- Number of transformer layers

## Model Architecture
The Swin Transformer consists of the following key components:
- Patch Partition: Splits an input image into non-overlapping patches.
- Linear Embedding: Projects patch features into a higher-dimensional space.
- Swin Transformer Blocks: Implements self-attention using a shifted window mechanism.
- MLP Head: Produces final predictions for classification tasks.

## Results
Example results after training on dataset:
| Model | Dataset | Accuracy |
|--------|---------|----------|
| Swin-T | CIFAR-10 | 92.3% |
| Swin-S | ImageNet | 83.1% |
